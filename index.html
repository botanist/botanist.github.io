                  The smart assistant from Botani.st helps you succeed better in your gardening by making sure everything is as optimal as it can be.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our small sensors constantly measure soil moisture, temperature and light. If your plant is running low on water, sitting to warm or some other problem we
                  alert you so you can save it before it's to late. Or improve greenhouse yields by optimizing the microclimate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A modular and open design allows for many kinds of both sensors and actor from us, makers and other 3rd parties.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So no matter if you are a hobbyist gardener, forgetful student or tech-savvy professional we think Botani.st is perfect for you.

                  The start-kit with wired sensors is cheapest and excellent if you want to try Botani.st in a single window or on your balcony.<br/><br/>
                  If you only have a few single pots or outdoors we recommend going with the kit containing wireless sensors.<br/><br/>
                  For the greenhouse enthusiast we also have a kit containing a wireless hub and more wired sensors.<br/><br/>
                  We also offer extra sensors and hubs to cover your needs.

                  Botani.st doesn't really require an internet connection so simply plug in power to the controller and you are up and running.<br/><br/>
                  To add a wireless device hold it in close proximity to the controller and it will activate and pair. Wired devices you just connect to a hub or the controller.<br/><br/>
                  By default sensors are configured with reasonable values suitable for most normal plants.<br/><br/>

              As makers and open source devotes we believe that no system is perfect from the start and the way greatness is 
              achieved is thru collaboration. When we began it was only natural for us to open up as much as possible of 
              Botani.st for others to build on.

                <h3>APIs</h3>
                <p>
                  In addition to working standalone or synced to our cloud service our controller <strong>can sync to your service</strong> 
                  as long as it implements the proper API:s. We'll provide a stub server implementation that you can build upon.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our browser-based interface and app communicates with the controller using standard web technologies. The 
                  cloud service implements pretty much the same API as the controller. Perfect if you want to write 
                  your own client or extract data into a spreadsheet.
                </p>

                <h3>Sensors &amp; Actors</h3>
                <p>
                  Perhaps you want to measure CO<sub>2</sub> in your greenhouse, water temp. in your hydroponics setup or maybe controlling some valves?
                </p>
                <p>
                  To build a custom device you can start easily with an Arduino or similar and use our simple SDK<sup>1</sup>. All 
                  electrical specifications and protocols will be made freely available for building wired devices.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sensors and actors operate with "raw values" so the processing part is run on the controller and you write 
                  this in JavaScript which can be easily modifed via the browser interface.
                </p>

                <h3>Virtual devices</h3>
                <p>
                  If you have an existing network device such as a PLC you can create a virtual device to interface with them. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Virtual devices are run on the controller and can create outgoing connections over raw sockets or via higher 
                  level protocols such as HTTP. Like physical devices the virtual devices are implemented using JavaScript.

                <h3>Open data</h3>
                <p>
                  If you use our free cloud service the price you pay is that we make your sensor data and selected metadata available to others.
                </p>
                <p>Why? Because
                  we think this is hugely beneficial to have real world data that other growers and the scientific community can 
                  use for the greater good.
                </p>
                <p>Controllers not synced to our cloud service however are completely private except upwards syncing of plant database
                  adjustments.

                    Botani.st is truly centered around our controller. Having a powerful central device that manages, gathers 
                    and analyses has allowed us to greatly simplify our sensors and thus make them really affordable. This has 
                    also allowed us to create a completely standalone product that doesn't rely on external processing in the 
                    cloud. That means you can use Botani.st where there's no internet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although it works standalone we do recommend you sync it against our cloud service. Not only does this
                    give you access to your data from anywhere in the world but your data also helps improve our plant database and
                    recommendation algorithms which in the long run helps you.

                    The controller provides a simple and intuitive interface accessible via your browser. Or, you can use our app 
                    available for iOS and Android.

                  <p>
                    With a powerful processor and plenty of memory it has the horsepower to handle your complete garden. It connects 
                    to your network either via a normal network cable or thru Wi-Fi. What if you have no network? no problem as it 
                    can act as an access point<sup>1</sup> for your smartphone or tablet.

                  <p>
                    The controller has single port that allows for daisy-chaining of Botani.st compatible devices. Perfect so you
                    can look after those plants sitting in the window where you have the controller.

                    Our soil moisture sensor is of a capacitive sensor type. It's not as sensitive to nutrients or temperatures 
                    as simpler resistance based sensors. It works in most types of soil and soil replacement mediums such as 
                    coconut fibers.

                  <p>
                    Two temperature sensors, one a few centimeters below and one above ground, measures temperature accurately. 
                    The below temperature sensor is perfect for controlling optimal seed germination.

                  <p>
                    The ambient light sensor can track wether it's dark, indoors, overcast, sunny or in between. Since ambient 
                    light can change fast we make sure to sample often for accurate readings.

                    Each hub comes with a number of ports to which sensors and actors are connected. Using daisy chaining it 
                    allows for, in theory, up to 120 connected devices but the actual number will be more in the range of 60-70 
                    depending on the daisy chain length.

                  <p>
                    Botani.st uses a low-power radio on the free 2.4 GHz band. In free line-of-sight range between two nodes is 
                    roughly 50 meters. Indoors thru stud walls this is reduced to about 10 meters.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But since our network builds a <strong>self-healing mesh network</strong> where nodes route traffic via each other 
                    the effective range is virtually limitless. Mesh networking also increases reliability because if one node 
                    goes down the traffic can go another way to its target. Much like how the internet works.

                    Since Botani.st is not only designed to gather input but also to control it is
                    important that communication is done in a safe and encrypted way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Thus, to prevent eavesdropping and the execution of unauthorized commands, we encrypt all messages using AES-128 with 
                    keys exchanged during pairing. No more neighbours playing tricks on you.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition to our radio traffic being encrypted we also make sure that all traffic between the controller, our cloud service,
                    your smartphone and browser is encrypted.
