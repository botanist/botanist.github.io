                    Technology is not only for humans. Here at botani.st we're working hard to create a simple, 
                    open and affordable ecosystem for taking care of our green friends. No matter if you only have a few plants
                    or a whole garden we'll help you take care of them.

                <p>
                    Even if you are not tech-savy getting started with our system is super easy. Our hosted solution<sup>1</sup> is the cheapest 
                    and simplest way to get started.
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li>Create an account via your browser or our iOS app.</li>
                        <li>Unpack the gateway and either register your IP-address with us or scan the code on the back from the app or via your browser.</li>
                        <li>Connect the gateway to your network and it'll associate itself with your setup.
                        <li style="color: #999">Optionally scan the code on your sensors or hubs to approve them directly. If not, you'll 
                            be prompted when they request to join your setup.</li>
                        <li>Put the sensors in the soil and wait for them to start flashing <span class="text-success">green</span>. That 
                            means they've joined a setup and are ready to start monitoring.</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                        <i>Further configuration, if necessary, can be done via your smartphone/tablet or PC.</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our wired and wireless basic sensors will monitor soil and air temperature, moisture and light conditions regularly. 
                    We process this data and run the results against the selected target conditions. If 
                    there's a discrepancy the affected sensor will start flashing in <span class="text-warning">orange</span> or if things 
                    are really bad in <span class="text-danger">red</span>. If you wish, a notification can also be pushed to your 
                    smartphone.

            <div class="container">
                <h1>Growing your installation</h1>
                <p>
                    Start small and grow as needed. All you need is a gateway and one or more sensors or actuators.
                </p>
                <div class="indent">
                <h3>Gateway</h3>
                <p>
                    The gateway serves as a connection point to the wireless network our solution uses. It connects to our hosted solution 
                    but can also be used for extending the range of a local controller. The gateway contains a cache where data is 
                    temporarily stored if there's a network problem so no data is lost.
                </p>

                <h3>Hubs</h3>
                <p>
                    If you keep your plants in clusters or have a greenhouse and want to keep costs down we provide wired versions of some 
                    sensors such as the basic one. These connect to our hub which has 8 ports but can be extended to up to 64 ports. Hubs talk 
                    wirelessly with the gateway or local controller and has a storage to cache readings if contact is lost. Power is 
                    provided from the built-in battery with solar cells that charges it. There's also a Micro-USB port for external power 
                    if lots or sensors are connected and the sun isn't enough to charge it.                    
                <p>

                <h3>Hub extenders</h3>
                <p>
                    With the use of a hub extender one port can become eight. This is handy if you have a larger greenhouse where the 
                    cable to the sensors is too short to reach far aways plants or you don't want many cables lying around in the same 
                    direction. 
                </p>

                <h3>Wired basic sensor</h3>
                <p>
                    Our basic sensor measures soil moisture, temperature and light. Soil moisture is done via dielectric permittivity. The 
                    amounts of nutrients or acidity of the soil doesn't affect the reading as much as it does for simpler sensors that 
                    usually measure electrical conductivity. Temperature is measured both in air and about 3 cm down in the soil. The part 
                    above ground is about 2.6 cm square and under 1 cm thick so it's tiny enough not to be intrusive.
                </p>

                <h3>Wireless basic sensor</h3>
                <p>
                    The wireless sensor has all the same capabilities as the wired sensor except it's, well, wireless! Since it has a built-in
                    battery and solar cell to charge it we had to make it a bit bigger measuring about 3 x 4 cm and under a cm thick.
                </p>

                <h3>Local controller</h3>
                <p>
                    If you don't have internet access where you want your setup and still want to run botani.st you'll need to use our 
                    local controller. It's basically our hosted solution but locally<sup><a href="fn1">1</a></sup>. This also means 
                    there's no monthly fee for using the system. You can reuse your existing gateways as these will connect to your 
                    local controller if available and then extend the range.
                </p>

                    With a background in open source it's important to us that you can use and extend the system for things we haven't 
                    thought about and access data which is yours. Sensor data, both unprocessed and processed, is simply available via 
                    HTTP using REST and JSON.

                    if you want. We'll provide a simple SDK for <a href="http://www.atmel.com">Atmel AVR</a> MCUs that you can use to get
